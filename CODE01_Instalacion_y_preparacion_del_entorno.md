Web Components and Polymer
==========================================================

Hello and welcome!.

This part of the Cells course is **mainly aimed at those not familiar with Web Components and/or Polymer**, but you can take it as a refresher too!.

If you are **starting from scratch**, it's recommended that **you take the labs in order**; if you have **previous knowledge** maybe you'll want to skip some: **up to you!**. Each lab builds on the previous one, but **you can take them in any order you want** with only minor adjustments.

We hope you enjoy it, learn and have fun along the way!.

**Let's get started!**.

Preparing the Cells enviroment
==========================================================

Even if this part of the course is **more focused on Web Components and Polymer**, it's still part of the Cells course, so it's important that we **prepare an environment suitable for both**.

So please go the **Environment Installation** part of the Cells course and do all the labs there.

Please **do this before trying the following part of the course**. If you don't do it this way **it may make things harder for you**.


Preparing the Polymer environment
==========================================================

So, completed the Cells **Environment Installation**? nice! If all went good, you should've installed **bower** and **npm** along with other tools.

Let's make sure! open a terminal and enter in the command line:

    bower --version

    npm --version

If you see appropriate version output in **both** of these commands, you're good to go! if not, refer back to the instructions and fix bower and/or npm.

### Installing polymer-cli

If you followed the Cells Environment Installation labs, you'll have installed the cells-cli tool. For working with Polymer, we are going to **install the polymer-cli tool**.

We're going to use the **-g** flag, so we have it **available for any project**.

In the command line enter:

    npm install -g polymer-cli

And **that's it**! That's all we need for now.

Make sure it's working by entering this in the command line:

    polymer

You **must see output** from that command, showing the different functionalities available for polymer cli (remember cli stands for Command Line Interface).

We're all set! See you at the next lab, in which **we'll learn the basics of Web Components and Polymer**.
